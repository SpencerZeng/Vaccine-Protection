# Vaccine Protection
Covid-19 has rampaged throughout the entire world ever since its spread began in 2019. Meanwhile, there have been scientific advances made to combat the virus with vaccinations and boosters. This project was conducted to explore the effectiveness of vaccination status on cases and deaths in California. There is an emphasis on the effects of the booster vaccination on deaths since that is the most recent advancement. Overall, it was found that, as individuals have more vaccinations, the death rate appears to be lower. Moreover, although total deaths appear to have a negative relationship with the population of California that has been boosted, it is unlikely that a linear model would describe the relationship between the two variables the most effectively.
